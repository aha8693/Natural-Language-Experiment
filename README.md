# Natural-Language-Experiment

This is my AVL and treap map implementations and profiling using two maps. 

Objectives: 
• Analyzed natural language from input (journalism/text) files by organizing unique sets of words and their frequency into various binary search tree maps, including AVL Tree Map and Treap Map.

• Designed a Java language-based experiment that analyzes the cost of running various binary search tree maps by quantitatively measuring each tree’s run time complexity and space complexity.
